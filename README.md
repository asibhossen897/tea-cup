## About The Project

![Screen Shot](images/screenshot.png)

I was really curious about my CSS skills. So brother <a href="https://github.com/SiyamMahdi">Siyam Mahdi</a> suggested me to take on this project from Figma file which was provided by <a href="https://github.com/ProgrammingHero1">Programming Hero</a>. So I started working on this project and as far and deep I went into this, my confidence level boosted and I learned so many things. This is not perfect yet but I'm trying my best. üòç <br>
